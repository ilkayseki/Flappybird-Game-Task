# Flappybird
This is a clone Flappybird for task. Task is here;

Please review the requirements below.
General requirements:
- Please create a git repository and use it to store the project files. We suggest a private
repository on github or gitlab for example. After finishing the task please provide us with
access to the repository so we are able to review your solution.
- The finished game should be submitted in the form of an android apk file. Please provide
a link where the apk can be downloaded or add it directly to an email.
- We evaluate the game’s functionality, the quality and style of the code/project.
Game requirements:
Please create a game similar to Flappy Bird in Unity. The art style is up to you. The quality and
aesthetic of the visual presentation will not be evaluated - it just needs to be functional.
Specific requirements for the game:
- Upon game launch a start menu is presented with an option to start the game by
pressing the “Start” button.
- The game does not have a win condition - it can be played infinitely.
- Every time the player-controlled bird passes through a set of pipes a point is awarded to
the player.
- The points counter should be displayed on the UI.
- After failing to pass a set of pipes the player loses and is presented with a loss screen
which allows the player to restart the game as well as displaying the number of points
the player managed to score during the current attempt.
- The game should maintain a list of 5 highest scores. The list should be persistent
between game sessions.
- If a player has achieved a top-5 score they should be presented with a notification about
it on the loss screen.
- Every 10 sets of pipes the player passes, they receive a bomb.
- A bomb can be activated by pressing a designated button on the UI.
- When a bomb is activated all sets of pipes currently visible on the screen are destroyed.
- Maximum count of pipe gameobjects in the scene should never exceed 20, regardless of
the length of the session.
